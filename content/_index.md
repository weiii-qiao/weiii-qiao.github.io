## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree at Group 4 (G4), Laboratory 9, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS). My research focuses on cybersecurity, specifically in host-based intrusion detection, APT provenance, and LLM agents for security. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from Xidian University.

## Research Interest

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam finibus ipsum
ac erat aliquam dapibus. Vestibulum vehicula placerat ex, a consectetur odio
pharetra quis[^1]. Mauris id urna ante.

Fusce pharetra diam ac nisi aliquet, velegestas ex iaculis. Pellentesque
laoreet cursus tellus sed pellentesque. Praesent a rhoncus elit[^2]. Nunc
ipsum nisl, consequat sit amet pretium quis, gravida id ipsum.
